# Pitstop Academy
This is my First project on the Full Stack Web Developer at Code Institute course. The aim was to build a front-end website that was fully responsive on all devices widths mobile, tablet and desktop. After reading the brief, I decided to create my own unique website about a training academy for tyre fitting as this is something I have always felt is needed in the industry from my experience.

Pitstop Academy aims the be the standard for formal training in the tyre industry providing workers with
qualifications and certificates to prove their skills and knowledge in the industry. Without formal education 
bad working practices may fall into place if workers are unknowingly performing them due to lack of education 
and training in the workplace. These practices are passed on to collegues and employees down the line who may be doing things 
wrong even though they seem right because its how they were shown. Pitstop Academy aims to stop this and teach
workers more about theory and principles of tyre fitting and all the work related. This will lead to a higher standard of work
and understanding in the industry and also reduce risk of injury, damage to vehicles, equimpment, tyres etc. and 
also reduce risk for all road users in the case of an accident caused due to bad working practices.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

The Navigation bar features on all pages of the website except for the safety course application form. It is fully responsive, includes links to the Home page, Courses page and the Apply Now page. It is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. The nav bar will let the user easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

#### Hero Section

The hero section includes a photograph and some text explaining who we are at pitstop academy. The text has been styled to be big and bold to make it stand out against the background for good ux and accessability.

The hero image has been made fully responsive and will suit all device widths for a good user experience.

#### About Us

A section where the user can learn a little bit about what we do here at Pitstop Academy.

![ about us section ](/assets/images/about-us.md.jpg "Text to show on mouseover")


#### Our Courses Section

This section shows the user a breif description of the courses we provide and each course section has a call to action to either find out more information about the courses or apply to either one of the courses.

It has been made responsive for all devices where the image beside the course will disappear on smaller screen sizes to prevent content from overlapping.

The user will see the benefits of the courses. This should encourage the user to consider apply to the course that appeals to them.

#### Contact Section

The contact section contains a phone number, email and our address if the user wished to contact us for more information and queries. This sections heading has been styled red to make it stand out better to the user.

This section also contain an iframe with an exact pin location on google maps so the user will know where to find us and how to get there. If clicked this will open in a new tab to prevent the user from being taking away from our website.

#### Footer

The footer contains links to all of our socail media which will open in a new tab if clicked by the user as so not to take them away from our website if clicked. It is designed to be simple and effective.

#### Courses Page

The courses page provides information on both of our courses including:

- Benefits of taking the courses
- Objectives of the applicants
- Content provided in the course
- Duration and price of the course

There is also a link to a application form for each course.

The  first courses is an apprenticeship program which will allow applicants to learn while they earn on the job
while been provided with top quality training and experience and the content provided should encourage the user to apply.

The second course is about roadside breakdowns and safety for all workers working on the side of the road which is very common in 
the industry. It provides knowledge on how to be safe while working on the roadside and how to be set up for doing a breakdown on the roadside.
The content provided will encourage the user to apply.

#### Application Forms

The apprenticeship application form has its own page on our website as it is expected to be the main reason user will come to our website.
This page will allow users to apply to our apprenticeship program and provide some details to us.
They will be asked to provide their name, email, date of birth, phone number and address. They will also be asked to confirm whether they hold a full or provisional driving licence in Ireland. Applicants also have the chance to add their cv to the form and some additional information about themselves which they think might be useful. The last two fields will not be required to complete the form. Most fields are required and the correct syntax is needed to complete to course to ensure the user completes the form fully and correctly. If details are incorrectly added it will be made clear to the user so they can fix it.

The form for the saftey course is very similar only applicants will noy be asked to provide a cv or any additional information.

This form will open in a separate tab for easy navigation for the user and does not contain the navigation bar only our logo which will bring the user back to the home page if clicked.

### Features Left To Implement

- I would like to add more photos of the work being acheived at Pitstop Academy with a gallery page with images and videos.

- I would like to implement a page with free information and advice for all users.

- I want to add several more courses specifically for the fitting of all different types of tyres.  

- I would like to make my own success page on completion of the application forms to thank users for applying to our courses instead of using the https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/.

- I would like to change the layout of the apply now page when there are more courses available so that there is a link to the form for each course to open in a separate tab like displayed in the second form for the Roadside Breakdowns and Safety Course.

### Testing 

#### Browser and Screen Size Testing

- I tried my website on as many different browsers as I could like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Avast Secure, Safari, Opera and Firefox.

- I also tested my website on my Iphone, Ipad and Computer and was happy with the outcome on each device.

- I used the web developer tools consistenly to ensure my website was responsive at mobile screen sizes and then at larger screen sizes. I used the device feature of dev tools to test my website on all devices available.

- I tried to commit my changes as much as possible. Like the testing I did this throughout the project to ensure I had lots of versions, and I could go back to a previous version should a major error occur.

- I tested the website, both on mobile and desktop. I clicked on all the links on the nav bar on every page and also click on all the links to the application forms and anchors. I also entered information into the application form and ensure they were prompted to enter information into every field that was designed with the 'required' attribute.

#### Validator Testing

##### HTML
- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
##### CSS
- No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

##### Acccessibility

- I confirmed thst the colors and fonts chosen were easily read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

![ lighthouse ](/assets/images/lighthouse.md.jpg "Text to show on mouseover")

#### Unfixed Bugs

- There was a slight change in the style on the "apply now" and "more details" buttons on safari but I was happy with how they looked so I left it unchanged.

- In the future I would like to make my own success page on completion of the application forms to thank users for applying to our courses instead of using https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/. The first Project is only front-end development and the back-end of the site is not supported on the information from the forms in not going to a real server.

### Deployment

This site was deployed to GitHub pages.

I created my Repository on Github and coded the entire project on Gitpod. VSCode is my text editor. It has a built in terminal so I could do everything I needed in one place. GitHub is where my repository is held externally. I deployed the site to Github Pages from Github in the repository settings where I set the branch to main and saved it. I then refreshed the page and a detailed ribbon was displayed saying my site was successfully deployed.

### Credits

#### Content

- To my mentor, Andre Aquilina , for guiding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction.
- The Slack community. The help a student is able to receive from the other students is a really great tool to have.
- To all at Code Institute, the videos and information I received was top class and was what helped me create my first portfolio project. 

-  HTML5 provided the content and the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
- CSS was used to style my web pages.

- The icons in the footer and home page were taken from https://fontawesome.com/.
- The two main fonts I used were imported from https://fonts.google.com/.
- The colour scheme I chose was helped with http://colormind.io/.
- I checked the contrast between background and foregrouns were up to accessability quideline standards using https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.
- The image used to show my website is fuly responsive is taken from https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?.

- I used https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://stackoverflow.com/ alot throughout my project to help me when I was stuck with how to write my code. I used w3school to help me center the cover text on my hero image. I also learned that a button element nested inside an anchor element is not valid html when I validated it and stack overflow provided me with the alternative to my problem.

- I used google maps to copy the code for the iframe element on my home page.

- I used the https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ for the success pages on completion of the forms in my website.

- I took alot of inspiration for my design from the Love Running and coffee codershouse Projects.

- I used the address and location in the iframe of the company I currently work for https://www.midlandtyres.ie/.

- Some of the text for the Courses was taken from https://training.michelin.co.uk/courses/licence-to-fit-roadside-recovery/.

#### Media

The images used for this website were taken from https://www.pexels.com/

These images were cropped and edited using Paint.

##### copied code

- As stated above, I used various websites to import animations and fonts etc. However, I explicitly copied code from love running project for my footer and at the start of the project for the nav bar which i later changed to make it more responsive as I really liked the design they used in the project and wanted to include it in my own.
- I used the https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ for the success pages on completion of the forms in my website.
