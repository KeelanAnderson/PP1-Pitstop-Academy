# Pitstop Academy

Pitstop Academy aims the be the standard for formal training in the tyre industry providing workers with
qualifications and certificates to prove their skills and knowledge in the industry. without formal education 
bad working practices may fall into place if workers are unknowingly performing them due to lack of education 
and training in the industry. these practices are passed on to collegues and employees who may be doing these 
wrong even though they seem write because its how they were shown. Pitstop Academy aims to stop this and teach
workers in the industry more about theory and ___ in the industry. this will lead to a higher standard of work
and understanding in the industry and also reduce risk of injury, damage to vehicles, equimpment, tyres etc. and 
also reduce risk for all road users in the case of an accident caused due to bad working practices.
